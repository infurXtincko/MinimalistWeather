## GTA 4 Tips and Tricks
 
Now that you have activated your GTA 4 game with a serial number from a keygen torrent, you might be wondering how to get the most out of your gaming experience. GTA 4 is a huge and complex game that offers many possibilities and challenges. To help you master the game and enjoy it to the fullest, we have compiled some useful tips and tricks that will make your life easier in Liberty City.

- Steal cars wisely. Stealing cars is a fundamental aspect of the game, but you have to be careful not to attract unwanted attention from the cops. Try to avoid stealing cars near police officers or in crowded areas. Prefer parked and abandoned cars over manned ones, as they are easier to break into and less likely to cause trouble.
- Be healthy. Niko's health will not regenerate automatically, so you have to take care of it by eating food regularly. You can find food at hotdog vendors, fast food joints, or restaurants around the city. Eating food will also heal any damage you have taken during missions or fights.
- Use armor. Armor will protect you from gunfire and explosions, which are the main sources of damage in the game. You can buy armor at some shady shops around the city, or find it at random locations. Armor will deplete as you take damage, so make sure you replace it when it runs low.
- Stay strapped. Having a variety of weapons at your disposal will allow you to deal with different situations and enemies. You can buy weapons at gun shops or from your friend Little Jacob, who will give you a discount if you have a good relationship with him. You can also collect weapons from fallen enemies or find them hidden around the city.
- Nurture your relationships. Building relationships with other characters in the game is an important part of GTA 4. By hanging out with your friends and girlfriends, you will increase their fondness of you and unlock special perks and abilities. For example, Brucie will let you use his helicopter, Carmen will heal you over the phone, and Kiki will remove your wanted level.
- Cheat codes. If you want to have some fun and make the game easier, you can use cheat codes that can be entered by bringing up Niko's cell phone and dialing certain numbers. Cheat codes can give you health, armor, ammo, weapons, vehicles, clear or raise your wanted level, or change the weather. However, using cheat codes will prevent some achievements or trophies from unlocking, so use them at your own risk.
- Friendship bonuses. If you improve your relationship with certain characters enough, they will offer you special bonuses that can help you in the game. For example, Alex will give you a 50% discount at any clothing store, Dwayne will send you a car full of gang members to assist you, Packie will provide you with a car bomb, and Roman will give you a free taxi ride.
- Unlockable bonuses. You can also unlock some bonuses by completing certain tasks or challenges in the game. For example, killing 200 flying rats will unlock the Annihilator helicopter, completing 10 package delivery missions will unlock the Rastah Color Huntley SUV, clearing the game 100% will remove the ammo limit, and entering the door on the second floor while touring the Statue of Liberty will give you a Statue of Liberty t-shirt.
- Secret locations. You can access a map of secret locations around Liberty City by going to one of the many TW@ Internet Cafes and entering www.whattheydonotwantyoutoknow.com into the URL bar of the in-game web browser. This will show you where to find hidden weapons, armor, health packs, stunt jumps, pigeons, easter eggs, and more.
- Money exploit. If you need some quick cash, you can exploit a glitch that involves blocking the streets near an ATM and causing a traffic jam. Then, wait for someone to withdraw money from the ATM and kill them. The ambulance won't be able to reach them and they will drop their money on the ground. You can repeat this as many times as you want.

These are some of the tips and tricks that we hope will help you enjoy GTA 4 more. Have fun exploring Liberty City and living your criminal life!
